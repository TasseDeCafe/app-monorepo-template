this corresponds to our wykop campaign number 6 here:

our wykop campaign number 4 got removed from the main page so we have to be creative and stop naming the links like /links/wykop-4

to make our directory structure sorted by the publish date, instead of calling it car-fish, we will be calling it zen1, zen2, zen3, etc
